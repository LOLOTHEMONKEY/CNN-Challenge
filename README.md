Model Training Challenge!
In this notebook, there are a whole host of weird errors. Some of them will be obvious and throw an error, but some are less clear and will break things without telling you they're breaking. Do your best to sniff out the mistakes in both code and training procedure!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is:

Work together in groups of 4 to complete this notebook
Figure out all the coding mistakes and make a notebook that runs
Find the mistakes in training and take appropriate corrective measures so the model trains well!
Make a ~15 minute long presentation showing your results and the steps you took to find and solve them.
Rules
If you cannot correct the problem, identify it and write a quick paragraph about what you would do
You are allowed to use any resource you can find; other groups, TA's, a random scientist walking by, and most importantly, the internet. The use of generative AI is highly discouraged - not because it's cheating, but because it can send you down rabbit holes that are hard to find your way out of.
